# NeuroEvolution

A hybrid optimization algorithm combining gradient descent for network parameter optimization 
coupled with an evolutionary algorithm for network topology and training hyperparameter 
optimization.

Work in progress.

## Networks

Currently, only fully-connected neural networks (Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs)) are supported.

## TODOs
    - Implement better dataloader for neuroevolution that works with subsets.
    - Split configs entirely.
