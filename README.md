# NeuroEvolution

A hybrid optimization algorithm that combines gradient descent for network parameter optimization and an evolutionary algorithm for network topology optimization.

This repository is work in progress.

## Networks

Currently only fully-connected neural networks (Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs)) are supported.

## TODOs
    - Improve handling of parameter mutation with enriched config.
    - Improve logic of parameter mutation.
    - Implement better dataloader for neuroevolution that works with subsets.
    - Only change network topology? Or also hyperparameters?
