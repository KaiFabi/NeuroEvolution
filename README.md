# NeuroEvolution

A hybrid optimization algorithm that combines gradient descent for network parameter optimization and an evolutionary algorithm for network topology optimization.

This repository is work in progress.

## Networks

Currently only fully-connected neural networks (Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs)) are supported.
